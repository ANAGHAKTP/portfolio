## 2024-10-27 - [Lockfile Noise in PRs]
**Learning:** Running `pnpm install` or other commands that trigger lockfile generation can create massive noise (like a 4000+ line `pnpm-lock.yaml`) in PRs that are meant to be small and focused.
**Action:** Always verify `git status` before committing and avoid staging auto-generated lockfiles unless explicitly intended, especially when constrained by a strict line-limit rule.
## 2024-11-20 - Static Data in Components
**Learning:** Hardcoding static dictionaries or array manipulation rules inside the render loop of functional React components can cause unnecessary allocation and computation during re-renders, impacting client-side performance.
**Action:** Move static data objects, configuration mapping structures, and pure filtering or flattening operations that only rely on constant imports outside of the component function.
## 2024-11-21 - [LCP Image Optimization]
**Learning:** Next.js Image component defaults to lazy loading, which can delay the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) if the image is above the fold.
**Action:** Always add the `priority` prop to above-the-fold images to preload them and improve perceived performance and LCP.
