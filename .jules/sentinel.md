## 2024-06-17 - Client-side form limits missing
**Vulnerability:** External API forms (Google Forms integration) lack client-side input validation/limits.
**Learning:** Due to the absence of a backend and the use of mode: "no-cors" with direct form submission, there are no payload size protections, which could lead to excessively large payload submissions resulting in resource exhaustion.
**Prevention:** Always enforce client-side `maxLength` attributes on inputs and textareas that interact with external unvalidated endpoints.
